# Tutorial Platformer
Unity game containing key features of a platformer made by following tutorials of [Coding in Flow](https://www.youtube.com/@codinginflow).
I didn't change most of the core code that much other than adding a couple of different game features. Also drew all of the art by myself. Regardless i spend a considerable amount of time on this project and wanted to share it here with the proper credits.

**Tech Used:** C#, Unity
